Place local motion files in subfolders and list them in index.json.

Rules:
- Use local paths only (e.g. /vrm/motions/fbx/female_happy.fbx).
- Remote URLs are ignored by the app.
- Suggested folders:
  - /vrm/motions/fbx (Mixamo-style FBX clips)
  - /vrm/motions/vmd (MMD VMD clips)
- Keep this README and index.json tracked; motion binaries stay local.
